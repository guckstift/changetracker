changetracker
=============

The `changetracker` monitors a given directory in your filesystem for changes like:
* item added
* item removed
* item renamed / moved
* file content changed

... through calling a custom handler-object's callback methods.

You can use epydoc to generate a html reference into the subdirectory "doc". Just install epydoc and
run `./build-epydoc`
